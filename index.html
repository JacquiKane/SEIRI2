      IB Business is a course designed by a conglomerate of successful Business

      prepare students to enter business with a base level of understanding of
      techniques and entities in commerce.

      <!-- Note, each term is surrounded by span, and the a tag. The id is unique, and in the form of 
      id_whatever the term is, and class of keyTerm. -->
      <span id="id_brick_and_mortar" class="keyTerm"
        ><a href="#">Brick and Mortar store </a></span
      >, versus an
      <span id="id_e_commerce" class="keyTerm"
        ><a href="#">e-commerce</a> entity.</span
